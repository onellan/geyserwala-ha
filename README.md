***Home Assistant custom integration for Geyserwala***

# Installing into Home Assistant
At present this integration is a custom integration that consumes the HTTP REST interface,  a few steps are required to install it into your Home Assistant. If you would like consume the MQTT interface using your own custom entities see [MQTT.md](./MQTT.md)

To install it into your Home Assistant you have two options:

## Installing using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)

* Add this repo as an integration custom repo:
  * On the side bar menu select "**HACS**"..
  * Click the three dot menu in the top right.
  * Click on "**Custom repositories**".
  * Paste `https://github.com/thingwala/geyserwala-ha` into the "**Repository**" field.
  * Set the type to "**Integration**".
  * Click "**Add**".
* Search for "**Geyserwala**".
* Click on the integration.
* Click "**Download**" in the bottom right.
* Click "**Download**" in the popup.
* On the side bar menu select "**Developer Tools**".
* At the bottom left of the "**Check and Restart**" panel, click "**CHECK CONFIGURATION**".
* If you see "*Configuration will not prevent Home Assistant from starting!*", then click "**RESTART**" at the bottom right of the panel.

## Installing custom integration manually

* Download this repository as a ZIP file by clicking this [link](https://github.com/thingwala/geyserwala-ha/zipball/main).
* Uncompress the ZIP file, and browse into it.
* Move/copy the `thingwala_geyserwala` folder to `.../homeassistant/core/config/custom_components/thingwala_geyserwala`.
* On the side bar menu select "**Developer Tools**".
* At the bottom left of the "**Check and Restart**" panel, click "**CHECK CONFIGURATION**".
* If you see "*Configuration will not prevent Home Assistant from starting!*", then click "**RESTART**" at the bottom right of the panel.

An example using the Terminal Add-on on Home Assistant OS:

```
wget https://github.com/thingwala/geyserwala-ha/archive/refs/tags/v0.0.9.zip
unzip v0.0.9.zip
mkdir -p /config/custom_components/
cp -r geyserwala-ha-0.0.9/custom_components/thingwala_geyserwala /config/custom_components/
# Then test config and restart
```

# Multiple Devices
The Home Assistant entity IDs are derived from the Geyserwala "Hostname", so for cleaner entity IDs be sure to configure each Geyserwala with a unique hostname before adding the device.

# Adding your Geyserwala
The integration is written to allow Home Assistant to discover your Geyserwala on your network using Zeroconf. However if you do not get a notification:
* On the side bar menu select "**Settings**".
* Then select "**Devices & Services**"
* Then click "**+ ADD INTEGRATION**" at the bottom right of your browser.
* Type "*Geysewala*" into the search box.
* "*Geyserwala*" should show up in the list, click it.
* Enter the device details.
  * You can use your Geyserwala `IP` address as the `Host`, which you can find by looking on the device menus. Press SET 4 times, "Info" page 1.
* Click "**SUBMIT**", and then "**FINISH**".
* Your Geyserwala should now be available to your Home Assistant dashboard.

Note the integration includes advanced entities which are hidden by default. To change this: go to "**Settings**" -> "**Devices & Services**" -> Click the Geyserwala "*entities*" -> Adjust filters to show hidden entities -> Select the desired entites -> Click "**ENABLE SELECTED**" -> Edit the entities "*Advanced settings*". (If you find the Entity Status selection is disabled, first hide the entity.)

# Custom Entities
It is possible to configure additional entities to access more advanced Geyserwala values by adding an entry to `configuration.yaml`, e.g.:

```
thingwala_geyserwala:
  custom_entities:
    sensor:
    - name: Element Runtime
      key: element-seconds
      device_class: duration
      icon: mdi:heating-coil
      visible: True
      unit: s
    - name: Element Cycles
      key: element-cycles
      icon: mdi:heating-coil
      visible: True
    - name: Pump Runtime
      key: pump-seconds
      device_class: duration
      icon: mdi:pump
      visible: True
      unit: s
    - name: Pump Cycles
      key: pump-cycles
      icon: mdi:pump
      visible: True
```

Entity types `binary_sensor`, `number`, `sensor`, `switch` and `text` are supported. The schema for each type is defined in the Python file of the same name in the source.

# Polling Interval Options
The integration includes an options flow to tune polling in Home Assistant:

* Go to "**Settings**" -> "**Devices & Services**".
* Open your Geyserwala integration card and select "**Configure**".
* Set "**Update interval (seconds)**".

Notes:
* The integration enforces a safe minimum interval of 5 seconds.
* The default interval is 10 seconds.

# Updating Device Connection Settings
If you need to change the device connection settings (host, port, username, or password), you can reconfigure the integration:

## Reconfiguring Device Settings

1. Go to "**Settings**" -> "**Devices & Services**".
2. Find your Geyserwala device (not the integration, but the actual device listed under your integration).
3. Click the device to open its details page.
4. Click the "**⋮**" (three dots) menu in the top right.
5. Click "**Reconfigure**".
6. Update the device connection settings:
   * **Host**: IP address or hostname of the Geyserwala device
   * **Port**: Port number (default: 8080)
   * **Username**: Device username
   * **Password**: Device password
7. Click "**Submit**".
8. The integration will validate the new settings and automatically reload with the updated configuration.

**Notes:**
* The device will be validated before applying changes to ensure the connection is working.
* The integration will reload automatically after successful reconfiguration.
* If validation fails, you'll be returned to the reconfiguration form to correct the settings.
* To find your device's IP address, press SET 4 times on the device to view the "Info" page.

# Configuration Flow and Feature Management

The integration provides a comprehensive configuration UI for managing polling and enabling/disabling features. Your feature configurations are **always preserved** - disabling and re-enabling a feature restores your previous settings.

## Accessing Configuration

1. Go to "**Settings**" -> "**Devices & Services**".
2. Find your Geyserwala integration and click "**Configure**".

## Step 1: Integration Settings & Features

This step allows you to configure the polling interval and enable/disable features:

### Polling Configuration
* **Update interval (seconds)**: How often the integration polls the device
  * Minimum: 5 seconds
  * Maximum: 600 seconds
  * Default: 10 seconds

### Feature Toggles

Enable or disable the following features:

* **Enable Custom Services**: Provides services to control boost, mode, and error codes
  * Default: **Enabled**
  * Services: `set_boost`, `set_mode`, `read_error_codes`, `clear_error_codes`

* **Enable MQTT Transport**: Use MQTT for device communication instead of HTTP
  * Default: **Disabled**
  * Requires: Home Assistant MQTT broker configured

* **Enable Sensor Calibration**: Apply per-entity offset and multiplier adjustments
  * Default: **Disabled**
  * Use case: Correct sensor drift or scale conversions

* **Enable Alert Rules**: Create threshold and state-change alerts
  * Default: **Disabled**
  * Supports: Multiple alert conditions and severity levels

## Step 2: Configure Enabled Features

After enabling features, you'll see a second configuration step with settings for each enabled feature.

### MQTT Transport Configuration
**Only shown if MQTT Transport is enabled.**

- **Transport Protocol**: Select `http` or `mqtt`
- **MQTT Base Topic**: Root topic for device communication (default: `geyserwala`)

### Sensor Calibration Configuration
**Only shown if Sensor Calibration is enabled.**

- **Sensor Calibrations**: JSON object with per-entity calibration settings
  ```json
  {
    "sensor.geyserwala_temperature": {"offset": 0, "multiplier": 1},
    "sensor.geyserwala_humidity": {"offset": 5, "multiplier": 0.95}
  }
  ```

### Alert Rules Configuration
**Only shown if Alert Rules is enabled.**

* **Alert Rules**: JSON array of alert rule definitions
  ```json
  [
    {
      "rule_id": "temp_threshold",
      "entity_key": "temperature",
      "condition_type": "threshold",
      "condition_value": 60,
      "severity": "warning",
      "message_template": "Temperature is too high: {value}°C",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
  ```

## Feature Persistence

**Important**: Feature configurations are saved to your Home Assistant configuration, even when a feature is disabled. If you:
1. Enable a feature and configure it
2. Disable the feature
3. Re-enable the same feature later

Your previous configuration will be restored automatically. This allows you to temporarily disable features without losing your settings.

# MQTT Transport Support
The integration now supports both HTTP and MQTT transport modes, allowing you to choose the communication method that best suits your network.

## Enabling MQTT Transport

1. Go to "**Settings**" -> "**Devices & Services**".
2. Open your Geyserwala integration card and select "**Configure**".
3. In the **Integration Settings & Features** step, toggle "**Enable MQTT Transport**" to **ON**.
4. Click "**Submit**" to proceed to feature configuration.
5. In the **Configure Enabled Features** step:
   * Select "**mqtt**" from the **Transport Protocol** dropdown.
   * Set **MQTT Base Topic** (default: `geyserwala`).
   * Click "**Submit**".
6. Ensure your Home Assistant MQTT broker is properly configured.

## MQTT Topic Structure

The integration will use the following MQTT topics:
* **State subscription**: `{base_topic}/{device_id}/state` - Receives device state as JSON
* **Command publishing**: `{base_topic}/{device_id}/command` - Sends device commands

Example state payload:
```json
{
  "temperature": 45.5,
  "humidity": 60.0,
  "error_codes": [],
  "mode": "Manual"
}
```

Example command payload:
```json
{
  "action": "set_boost",
  "enabled": true,
  "duration_minutes": 30
}
```

# Device Diagnostics
The integration exposes device diagnostics for troubleshooting. Device Diagnostics are **automatically enabled** - no configuration required.

To access diagnostics:

1. Go to "**Settings**" -> "**Devices & Services**".
2. Select your Geyserwala device.
3. Click the "**Device Support**" menu (three dots icon).
4. Select "**Download Diagnostics**".

The diagnostics report includes:
* Coordinator state (last update, success/failure status)
* Device information (ID, name, hostname)
* Last error details (if any)
* Update timing information

# Custom Services
The integration provides services for advanced device control and automation. Custom Services are **enabled by default** - no configuration required. They are available via the Developer Tools or in automations.

## Enabling/Disabling Custom Services

To disable custom services:
1. Go to "**Settings**" -> "**Devices & Services**".
2. Open your Geyserwala integration card and select "**Configure**".
3. In the **Integration Settings & Features** step, toggle "**Enable Custom Services**" to **OFF**.

# Sensor Calibration
Adjust sensor values with per-entity offset and multiplier settings to correct sensor drift or calibration errors.

## Enabling Sensor Calibration

1. Go to "**Settings**" -> "**Devices & Services**".
2. Open your Geyserwala integration card and select "**Configure**".
3. In the **Integration Settings & Features** step, toggle "**Enable Sensor Calibration**" to **ON**.
4. Click "**Submit**" to proceed to feature configuration.
5. In the **Configure Enabled Features** step, enter your calibration JSON in **Sensor Calibrations** field.
6. Click "**Submit**".

## Calibration Formula

Each entity's sensor value is adjusted as follows:
```
adjusted_value = (original_value * multiplier) + offset
```

## Configuring Calibration

Sensor calibrations are configured by entering a JSON object with per-entity settings:

```json
{
  "sensor.geyserwala_temperature": {
    "offset": 2.5,
    "multiplier": 1.1
  },
  "sensor.geyserwala_humidity": {
    "offset": 0.0,
    "multiplier": 0.95
  }
}
```

**Example**: If your temperature sensor reads 45°C with calibration `{"multiplier": 1.1, "offset": 2.5}`, it will show as `(45 * 1.1) + 2.5 = 52.0°C`

# Alert and Notification Rules
Set up alert rules to monitor device conditions and trigger automations when thresholds are exceeded.

## Enabling Alert Rules

1. Go to "**Settings**" -> "**Devices & Services**".
2. Open your Geyserwala integration card and select "**Configure**".
3. In the **Integration Settings & Features** step, toggle "**Enable Alert Rules**" to **ON**.
4. Click "**Submit**" to proceed to feature configuration.
5. In the **Configure Enabled Features** step, enter your alert rules JSON in **Alert Rules** field.
6. Click "**Submit**".

## Configuring Alert Rules

Alert rules are configured by entering a JSON array of rule definitions:

```json
[
  {
    "rule_id": "high_temp_alert",
    "entity_key": "temperature",
    "condition_type": "threshold",
    "condition_value": 50.0,
    "severity": "warning",
    "message_template": "Temperature is high: {value}°C",
    "enabled": true
  },
  {
    "rule_id": "error_detected",
    "entity_key": "error_codes",
    "condition_type": "error_code",
    "condition_value": "E001",
    "severity": "critical",
    "message_template": "Error E001 detected",
    "enabled": true
  },
  {
    "rule_id": "mode_error",
    "entity_key": "mode",
    "condition_type": "state_change",
    "condition_value": "Error",
    "severity": "error",
    "message_template": "Mode changed to Error",
    "enabled": true
  }
]
```

## Alert Types

### Threshold Alerts
Triggers when a sensor value exceeds a specified threshold.
* `condition_type`: `threshold`
* `condition_value`: numeric threshold value

### Error Code Alerts
Triggers when a specific error code appears in the error_codes list.
* `condition_type`: `error_code`
* `condition_value`: error code string (e.g., "E001")

### State Change Alerts
Triggers when an entity changes to a specific state.
* `condition_type`: `state_change`
* `condition_value`: target state value

## Using Alert Events

Alert rules fire Home Assistant events that can be used in automations:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "React to high temperature alert"
    trigger:
      platform: event
      event_type: thingwala_geyserwala_alert
      event_data:
        rule_id: high_temp_alert
    action:
      service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
      data:
        message: "High temperature alert triggered"
```


This integration uses Home Assistant's `DataUpdateCoordinator` with production-focused behavior:

* Bounded retries with small exponential-style backoff during transient failures.
* Timeout protection for network I/O.
* Authentication failure escalation for config-entry reauth handling.
* Safer entity setup and icon fallback behavior for custom/unknown device values.

# Troubleshooting
If entities stop updating or appear unavailable:

* Check Home Assistant logs: **Settings** -> **System** -> **Logs**.
* Verify host/port/credentials in integration settings.
* Increase polling interval via options if your network is congested.
* Run "**Check configuration**" and restart Home Assistant.

# Development and CI
Local quality commands:

```bash
make setup
make check
make test
```

CI runs on GitHub Actions and includes:

* `hassfest` and HACS validation.
* Python linting (`ruff`).
* Unit tests (`pytest`).
